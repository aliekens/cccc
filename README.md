## Introduction

This is just a little bit of fun, trying to compute the number of hackers that
will roam <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015">CCC15</a>. Based on the
information found in the <a href="https://tickets.events.ccc.de/graph/">target
graphs</a>, I want to try to estimate the number of tickets sold, just to enjoy
the vast growing amount of hackers I will share the camp grounds with.
  
On the other hand, its also a case pro Open Data. It's an example of the not so
cool way of doing things these days. In stead of publishing a json file with
the data (# of tickets per category, # of t-shirts per category) and computing
a rendering on the client-size, the data is mangled into one representation on
the server side, requiring other consumers to reengineer the representation to
an approximation of the original data.
  
I thought hackers would be on the forefront of the openness of where the web is
heading. Seems I'm wrong :-(
  
Finally, it's also an excuse to have a little fun with JavaScript again, after
a long time, exercising a bit for things to come :-)
